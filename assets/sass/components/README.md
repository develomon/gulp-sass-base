# Components

For small components, there is the `components/` folder. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.

Most projects will have a `vendors/` folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those aside in the same folder is a good way to say “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.

If you have to override a section of any vendor, I recommend you have an 8th folder called `vendors-extensions/` in which you may have files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite. For instance, `vendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss` is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrap’s default CSS. This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.
